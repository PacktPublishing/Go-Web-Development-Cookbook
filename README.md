# Go Web Development Cookbook
This is the code repository for [Go Web Development Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/go-web-development-cookbook?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787286740), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Go is an open source programming language that is designed to scale and support concurrency at the language level. This gives you the liberty to write large concurrent web applications with ease. From creating web application to deploying them on Amazon Cloud Services, this book will be your one-stop guide to learn web development in Go. The Go Web Development Cookbook teaches you how to create REST services, write microservices, and deploy Go Docker containers. Whether you are new to programming or a professional developer, this book will help get you up to speed with web development in Go. We will focus on writing modular code in Go; in-depth informative examples build the base, one step at a time. You will learn how to create a server, work with static files, SQL, NoSQL databases, and Beego. You will also learn how to create and secure REST services, and create and deploy Go web application and Go Docker containers on Amazon Cloud Services. By the end of the book, you will be able to apply the skills you've gained in Go to create and explore web applications in any domain.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
for 
{
  conn, err := listener.Accept()
  if err != nil 
  {
    log.Fatal("Error accepting: ", err.Error())
  }
  log.Println(conn)
}
```

Readers should possess basic knowledge of Go and have Go installed on the machine to execute the instructions and the code.
